Ludum Dare 29 - Beneath the Surface

Ideas:

	mining

	a surface named Beneath

	iceberg sidescroller - small overworld, tall underworld

	the ability to see beneath people's surface emotions/behavior and reveal their true feelings/motivations/how they ended up in this situation

	explore the layers of (your own?) mind -- deeper layers are less rational, more random, more psychedelic
