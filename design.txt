Ludum Dare 29 - Beneath the Surface

Ideas:

	mining

	a surface named Beneath

	iceberg sidescroller - small overworld, tall underworld

	the ability to see beneath people's surface emotions/behavior and reveal their true feelings/motivations/how they ended up in this situation

	explore the layers of (your own?) mind -- deeper layers are less rational, more random, more psychedelic

	hidden magical sigils

Tech:

	Flask webapp - working

	madlibs - basic version is working, need themes (link to choices)

	room escape: make the player hunt down key items for puzzles in other rooms (which are all random...)

Story:

	Ben Eath, the Surface, goes about his day...

	You must always stay beneath the surface. Always.

	We are two people: the one on the surface, and the one beneath.

	Stay above the surface of the lake.
