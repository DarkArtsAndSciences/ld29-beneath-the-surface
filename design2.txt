#LD29, I need your help.

This isn't really a game. It's just the only way I have left to communicate.

I can't say I wrote it alone, either. Not that there are any other people involved. It's just...more like something that happened to me, something someone did to me, than something <b>I</b> did. <!-- BENEATH_MODE: someone->something -->

<!-- Please don't let this be something I did. -->

I <b>can</b> say it all started less than 48 hours ago. It doesn't take more than a weekend for your entire life to change->end.

Anyway, I'm not posting this to win, or for fame, or even just for fun. I just want to stop->start other people going through what I've been through.

Your life may depend->end on the information in this "game".

So I was having trouble coming up with an idea for #LD29. (Like everyone else, I was ready to make a game about Breaking the Rules.)

Long story full of foreshadowing to be written later, I decided to head out to my local office suppy store to pick up a whiteboard (that's where ideas come from, right?) and then realized I didn't have enough markers. Also they had bracelet USB drives on sale. And a glass standing desk whiteboard in a block of cork for sticking things to with sharp pins! I bet everyone else is making their graphics in Photoshop or something equally commonplace.

Maybe I'm too vulnerable to temptation.

Anyway, after leaning the larger whiteboard against the wall and drawing a rainbow-scented pile of lack of artistic talent on it, I decided to try out a new USB drive.

Maybe I'm just biased by what happened later, but I could swear I had a feeling that the idea I needed for my game was on that drive somehow. I mean, I know drives sometimes come with free terrible MP3s and stuff like that, and you can find inspiration in anything, but this was something more. Like a cold, solid certainty, like the way I felt when I signed my taxes two weeks ago, something final yet endless. Thanks for the support, we'll be back for more next year. I was that sure, that the idea was in there, that it was something I could use and reuse.

I wish I'd spent more time trying to come up with an idea of my own.

It didn't want to slide into the USB port at first, even after flipping it over repeatedly. I couldn't see anything wrong with it, but

It wouldn't go into the USB port. Flipped it a few times, still no luck. Finally I blew into it, as if it were an old NES cartridge, and a scrap of paper fell out, probably the "inspected by" sticker. Well, thank you for my protection. Without the paper in the way, the drive clicked neatly into the port and showed up on my computer a few seconds later.

It was empty.

Not even a readme file helpfully explaining how to install USB drivers so you can mount the drive and read it.

I hadn't expected working game code or anything like that. But an entertainingly terrible MP3 would have been nice. Even a wallpaper with a pixelated version of the company logo would have been something. I felt a rush of disappointment, then anger, far stronger than the situation deserved.

The drive name, SURFACE, was the only thing I could see on the screen. Just sitting there on the screen. Staring at me. Mocking me.

I renamed it DEAD_DRIVE, slammed the laptop lid down, and walked away.

(I could never use a desktop computer. There's no good way to properly express some emotions to them.)

---

Still couldn't think of any ideas. Didn't sleep well, kept having nightmares about an upside-down face.

When I went back to my computer, all my windows were closed except for the new drive. It was named BENEATH now, and contained several code and text files.

<screenshot of final code in Finder>

Curious, I opened a few files. It looked like some sort of web app, but I couldn't figure out what it did, and large sections of the code were commented out entirely.

It took some Serious Difficult Code Hacking, but eventually I figured out how to start the server,

<screenshot of ">python app.py">

and open the app.

<screenshot of localhost in Safari; there's already a saved game named BENEATH>

It's a game? Great! Maybe I'll steal it. I mean use it. This code wasn't here yesterday, so it's like I wrote it within the 48 hours, right? For all I know I wrote it myself while sleepwalking.

And then I noticed that the game's logo was the face from my nightmares.

---

The game opened, endgame is awesome, screenshot, etc.

Took me a minute to realize I'd reflexively hit the CONTINUE GAME button just to get that face off my screen. Good reflexes, self! All that gaming IS good for something!

I explore this save file for a while. Looks like this is right before the end boss. I don't know what I'm doing, though, and I'm having trouble with combat with easy NPCs. It'll look bad if the "developer" can't play their own game. I think I'll start a new save file. Maybe I'll make a walkthrough, too, since I don't have spend time actually making the game.

[NOTE: FAQ/walkthrough starts here. There's no accurate record of my time in the BENEATH save, except for the single screenshot above, and it's implied my file is different from yours. After this point, assume everything important was recorded as it happened.]

Oops, accidentally deleted BENEATH while trying to create a new game (or you're not allowed to have more than one). Hope the owner doesn't get mad...

WALKTHROUGH: SURFACE WORLD

Key features:

	Surface mode is very safe. It is almost impossible to die. [achievement: die in surface mode] However, you can quit to the main menu at any time.

	Surface mode is cheerful and friendly and so are its many NPCs.

	Surface mode has practice versions of Beneath mode's tasks.

	Cheat commands are available.

	Glitches and error messages sometimes appear, occasionally foreshadowing Beneath mode but mostly giving useful hints.

None of this matters, it's just a tutorial for the interface.

Beneath mode is sometimes visible in glitches, but can't be interacted with.

To continue, just quit (or die).

---

No, seriously, dying/deleting your save file unlocks the next part of the game. Your next new game will be created in Beneath Mode.

WALKTHROUGH: BENEATH MODE

Key features of Beneath Mode:

	UI colors are reversed.

	Some images are upside down.

	Some images are glitched with hidden messages.

	Quotes from Surface mode appear "out" of context (actually, this is the real one; in context, they're less funny/silly/surreal and more dark/disturbing)

	There are no stationary NPCs; you are pointedly alone.

	Twisted versions of Surface NPCs will occasionally appear (sometimes outside the usual game frame) and stare at you. This raises a hidden fear variable, which changes your behavior options.

	No NPC will attack you directly unless you attack/irritate them first. A combat system is implied, but they will always kill you in one shot while laughing. (increases fear and anger)

	You can access Surface mode temporarily (which improves mood).

	Death, via NPC or suicide, returns you to the main menu. The quit link is gone, but you can still quit at any time via cheat code.

	Three deaths get you an unskippable creepy cutscene of NPCs laughing at your corpse and another trip to the main menu.

	Your save file name is changed to YOU_FAILED. Playing just shows you the end of the cutscene. You aren't allowed to delete the file or create a new one.

At this point I'm frustrated and go to bed. More nightmares.

Next day...

I go back to the store, ask for info, find out it was a return, last owner died under mysterious circumstances and next-of-kin made them take it back. Store's done badly since then; they think it's bad luck and are glad it's gone.

I fiddle with the code for a while, looking for answers or at least a way to delete my file and start over. I reenable a block of code that looks like it allows multiple save files...that should do it.

I open the game in Safari and...

<screenshot>

Two save files. BENEATH is back.

I still can't create a new file, so I'll try playing this one.

WALKTHROUGH: THE SECOND SAVE

	Once again, you're near the end of the game. This save file seems subtly different from the first time you saw it, but you can't figure out why, and you don't have a log or screenshots (but one) of the original. [spoiler: this time it's angry]

	It's implied that there are dozens of hours of gameplay that you skipped.

	You're familiar with the game now, and feel ready to start attacking the NPCs. Also you're still angry at them for staring at you and not letting you fight back without instakilling you.

	However, the game has direct control of the browser now (you enabled that along with multiple save files), and will use it to (try to) prevent you from clicking the right choices. [if I can't actually autoload pages, ignore the player's wishes behind the scenes]

	Also, quit and other cheats are no longer available.

	I'm not able to finish the game due to not-implemented-yet errors. Looks like the code isn't complete.

	Eventually I manage to delete the file via in-game death, but I'm disturbed by what the game made me do and decide to stop playing it. [this is a lie...I played the same next level you will, and made the same deal...]

END FAQ

The Final Save (not documented IC)

	Both files have been replaced with DONT_FAIL_AGAIN.

	Back to Surface mode...or is it? The UI looks right, but the tone is different, darker. The glitches and hints are still there, but following the hints will hurt instead of help you. [spoiler: I'm gone, it's the end boss]

	The game starts addressing you directly, both via text and via NPCs looking at you (not at your avatar, at the player). If you resist, it gets angrier and more violent (you'll die repeatedly, but it just sends you back to the main menu), and will eventually start threatening you. If you act fearful or compliant, it will be friendlier and try to earn your trust. Either way...

	It wants your help.

	It wants you to help it spread.

	If you help, it will leave you alone.

	It wants you to vote for this game.

	All you have to do is vote, then you can stop playing and it will leave you alone.
