<p>This is a terrible excuse for a room description. You can't see a thing.</p>

<p>The walls are covered in fresh {{color}} paint.</p>

<p>You feel yourself throwing off your surface emotions and sinking deeper into your true self.</p>

<p>Out of the corner of your eye, you glimpse a pile of {{adjective}} {{animal}}s. You turn around to find the room empty except for a single piece of paper with a crude {{animal}} drawn on it in {{color}} crayon.</p>

<p>Your vision blurs as you try to examine the room. Questions swirl through your thoughts. Who are you? Why are you here? Was that a {{color}} {{animal}}? What are you digging for? Why do you feel so {{adjective}}? Why can't you see clearly?</p>

<p>You see a row of {{session.level}} short lines drawn on the wall in {{color}} crayon. You don't think they were there a minute ago. You don't see any crayons in the room, either.</p>
